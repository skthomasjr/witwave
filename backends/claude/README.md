# claude

claude is the Claude backend for the autonomous agent platform. It is a standalone A2A server that wraps the Claude
Agent SDK, managing its own sessions, conversation logs, trace logs, and Prometheus metrics.

## What it does

claude receives A2A JSON-RPC requests (forwarded by harness), runs them through Claude via the Claude Agent SDK
CLI, streams back the response, and logs everything to JSONL files.

Each named agent that uses Claude gets its own dedicated instance of this image (e.g. `iris-a2-claude`,
`bob-a2-claude`). Instances are completely isolated — separate sessions, logs, memory, and metrics.

## Key features

**Session continuity** — Sessions are tracked in an in-process LRU cache keyed by session ID. Resuming a session carries
conversation history forward. The SDK handles context window management; claude monitors usage and warns at 90%
utilization.

**MCP server support** — Loads MCP server definitions from a mounted `mcp.json` file. The file is hot-reloaded on each
request, so MCP servers can be added or reconfigured without restarting the container.

**Tool tracing** — Every `tool_use` and `tool_result` event is captured from the SDK stream and written to `trace.jsonl`
alongside summary response events. This gives full visibility into what tools Claude called and what they returned.

**Model override** — The model used for a given request can be overridden via `metadata.model` in the A2A message.
Resolution order: per-message metadata → routing config model → default model in `backend.yaml`.

**Agent identity** — Claude's system prompt is loaded from `/home/agent/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
The agent's name, personality, and behavioral constraints all live there. The file is hot-reloaded on change — updating
`CLAUDE.md` takes effect for the next request without restarting the container.

**Metrics** — Exposes a superset of the common `a2_*` Prometheus metrics, plus Claude-specific metrics: context window
token counts, context exhaustion events, tool call counts, MCP tool usage, and time-to-first-message.

**Hooks (PreToolUse / PostToolUse)** — A two-layer policy engine wraps every tool call the SDK makes. A conservative
**baseline** of deny rules ships with the executor and blocks the most obvious-dangerous shell patterns (`rm -rf /`,
`git push --force main`, `curl | sh`, `chmod 777`, `dd of=/dev/sdX`). Per-agent **extensions** layered on top live in a
`hooks.yaml` file mounted at `/home/agent/.claude/hooks.yaml` and are hot-reloaded. PostToolUse is always wired and
writes one JSONL row per tool call to `logs/tool-audit.jsonl` for a forensic trail. See [Hook configuration](#hook-configuration)
below.

## Secrets

Create a Kubernetes secret with the required credentials before deploying:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic <agent>-claude-secrets \
  --from-literal=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \
  --namespace nyx
```

For Claude Max (OAuth), use `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` instead of `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

Reference the secret in your Helm values:

```yaml
backends:
  - name: claude
    envFrom:
      - secretRef:
          name: <agent>-claude-secrets
```

## Runtime

claude mounts:

- `CLAUDE.md` — agent identity (system prompt), at `/home/agent/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- `mcp.json` — MCP server configuration (optional)
- `logs/conversation.jsonl` — conversation log file (must pre-exist as a file)
- `logs/trace.jsonl` — trace log file (must pre-exist as a file)
- `memory/` — persistent memory directory

Key environment variables: `AGENT_NAME` (instance name), `AGENT_OWNER` (named agent, e.g. `iris`), `AGENT_ID` (backend
slot id, e.g. `claude`), `AGENT_URL`, `BACKEND_PORT`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` for
Claude Max), `CLAUDE_MODEL` (model override), `METRICS_ENABLED`, `CONVERSATIONS_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TASK_STORE_PATH`,
`WORKER_MAX_RESTARTS`, `LOG_PROMPT_MAX_BYTES` (max bytes of prompt logged at INFO; default 200; set to 0 to suppress),
`HOOKS_CONFIG_PATH` (path to `hooks.yaml`; default `/home/agent/.claude/hooks.yaml`), `HOOKS_BASELINE_ENABLED`
(default `true`; set to `false` to disable the baseline deny rules), `TOOL_AUDIT_LOG` (path to the PostToolUse audit
JSONL; default `/home/agent/logs/tool-audit.jsonl`).

## Hook configuration

The executor wraps every Claude tool call with PreToolUse (policy) and PostToolUse (audit) hooks (#467).

**Baseline.** A fixed set of deny rules ships in `hooks.py` — see `BASELINE_RULES`. They match against the
JSON-serialised `tool_input` payload and reject obvious-dangerous shell patterns. The list is intentionally small and
narrow to minimise false positives; operators who want a stricter sandbox should add extensions. Set
`HOOKS_BASELINE_ENABLED=false` to turn the baseline off entirely (e.g. during bring-up of a permissive-by-design
agent).

**Extensions.** Per-agent opt-in rules are loaded from `/home/agent/.claude/hooks.yaml`. The file is optional; when
present it is hot-reloaded whenever it changes:

```yaml
extensions:
  - name: block-private-key-writes
    tool: "Write"                   # exact tool name; omit or "*" for any tool
    deny_if_match: "BEGIN PRIVATE KEY"
    reason: "refusing to write private keys"

  - name: warn-on-webfetch
    tool: "WebFetch"
    warn_if_match: ".*"
    reason: "network call"
```

Each rule must have a `name` and exactly one of `deny_if_match` or `warn_if_match` (regex, applied to the JSON
serialisation of `tool_input`). Invalid rules are skipped with a warning; malformed YAML keeps the previous ruleset in
place so an editing mistake cannot accidentally disable policy.

**Audit log.** PostToolUse always writes one JSONL row per tool call to `TOOL_AUDIT_LOG` (default
`/home/agent/logs/tool-audit.jsonl`) with fields: `ts`, `agent`, `agent_id`, `session_id`, `model`, `tool_use_id`,
`tool_name`, `tool_input`, `tool_response_preview` (capped at 2 KiB). PostToolUse is not opt-outable — transparency
is a guarantee, not a policy choice.

**Metrics.** `a2_hooks_blocked_total{tool,source,rule}`, `a2_hooks_warnings_total{tool,source,rule}`,
`a2_tool_audit_entries_total{tool}`, `a2_hooks_config_reloads_total`, and `a2_hooks_active_rules{source}`.

## Tracing (OpenTelemetry)

When `OTEL_ENABLED=true` is set, claude emits a server span for every `execute()` call and continues any trace
propagated by harness via the `metadata.traceparent` field (#469). The OTLP/HTTP exporter reads the standard
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` / `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` / `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` env vars. Resource attributes
(`service.name`, `agent`, `agent_id`, `backend`) are populated automatically. When `OTEL_ENABLED` is falsy
(default) the OTel call sites are no-ops. The bootstrap lives in `shared/otel.py` and is shared with the other
backends and the harness.
